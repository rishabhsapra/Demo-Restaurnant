                   Meeting someplace with old and new friends, ordering wine,
                    eating food, surrounded by strangers, I think is the core 
                    of what it means to live a civilised life.Some people ask the secret
                     of our long marriage. We take time to go to a restaurant two times a week.
                      A little candlelight, dinner, soft music and dancing. She goes Tuesdays,
                       I go Fridays.<br/><br/>

                       It's a funny thing. I'll be in my home town of Columbus at a restaurant 
                       or something, and the waiter maybe asks, 'What do you do?' and I say, 
                       'Oh, I'm in a band... Twenty One Pilots,' and he'll say, 'Cool, 
                       I'll check it out. I never heard of them.' And then I say, 'In 
                       September we're playing the Schottenstein
                        Center,' and it's like, 'What?!'<br/><br/>

                        People are the core of every business. Businesses are based on
                         relationships, and relationships are based on people. I would 
                         go to an average restaurant run by amazing people over an
                          outstanding restaurant run by awful people.<br/><br/>

                          It was tough times in Ohio when we lived there. 
                          My dad was between unemployed and just selling random 
                          knickknacks at a flea market. My mom was a cashier at a
                           Chinese food restaurant. They both had awesome careers
                            back in Taiwan, and they came here for my sister and I.<br/><br/>
